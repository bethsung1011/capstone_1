##   Proposal 2: 

##  [Ramen Ratings](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/ramen-ratings)

## information of the dataset: 

The Ramen Rater is a product review website for the hardcore ramen enthusiast (or "ramenphile"), with over 2500 reviews to date. This dataset is an export of "The Big List" (of reviews), converted to a CSV format.

Each record in the dataset is a single ramen product review. Review numbers are contiguous: more recently reviewed ramen varieties have higher numbers. Brand, Variety (the product name), Country, and Style (Cup? Bowl? Tray?) are pretty self-explanatory. Stars indicate the ramen quality, as assessed by the reviewer, on a 5-point scale; this is the most important column in the dataset!
